Greetings!

My name is Grant Esparza and I am a DevOps Engineer at Liatrio, a Enterprise
Delivery Acceleration firm. I graduated from California State University, Chico
with a degree in Computer Science and moved to Sacramento shortly after. I've
always had an obsession with tinkering and love the feeling of mastering new
challenges which helps makes me one of the lucky people who finds it easy to
love their job.

The internet is a wonderful place to absorb information and offers an almost
limitless library of topics to choose from. I've been lucky enough to take
advantage of work that the open source community has put forward and in the past
few years have expanded my skillset far beyond my expectations. Recently, I've
thought a lot about that this culture of learning and growth can only exist through
mass participation. This naturally led me to ask myself what I can do to give
back and potentially serve as an example of how others can contribute to a
community that thrives on knowledge-sharing. I hope to use this blog as a way of
distributing what I have learned and more importantly how I continue to make
learning a priority.

As a DevOps Engineer naturally much of the focus will be on tools that empower
teams to ship reliable code to end users. I'll admit however, that I'm easily
distracted by shiny things and like to experiment with projects that attract my
interest. So I hope to fill this site with a broad range of topics as my
journey continues and will always be looking out for what's around the corner.

Looking forward to getting started!
