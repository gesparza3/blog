My name is **Grant Esparza**.

I have a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** with a certificate in Data
Science from California State University, Chico. Beyond academia I also am a
certified Kubernetes Administrator.
 
My passions include learning new tooling to improve software delivery,
collaborating with others to develop innovative solutions, and most importantly
finding time to enjoy the outdoors with my dog.

Some of the tools I work with include Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and
Jenkins.

I'm comfortable programming in Javascript, C/C++, Dart, Python, & R; have
experience using Java, MySQL, & Groovy; and hope to work on projects in the
future that use Go & Rust.

Vim is life
